# What is Model Builder & how does it work?

Intro para

Video or animated gif of the model builder interface

## Scenarios

Talk about different scenarios, the problem being solved, the data they need, and map these onto the ML.NET task

Visual rather than lots of text

Use icons from the product

Scenario descriptions with example inputs and outputs

## Data

Data examples illustrating the features and the labels

Limitations

Connect to different sources

## Train

What does training mean?

Trying different algorithms / feature extraction / hyper-parameter tuning

## Evaluate

Re-spell out metrics

Best model
