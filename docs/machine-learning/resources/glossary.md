# Machine Learning Glossary

The following is a list of important machine learning terms that will be useful as you build your custom models.

**Accuracy:** The proportion of true results to total cases.

**AUC:** A value that represents the area under the curve when false positives are plotted on the x-axis and true positives are plotted on the y-axis.
  
**Binary Classification:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification)

**Classification:** When the data are being used to predict a category, supervised learning is also called classification. This is the case when assigning an image as a picture of either a 'cat' or a 'dog'. When there are only two choices, it's called two-class or binomial classification. When there are more categories, as when predicting the winner of the NCAA March Madness tournament, this problem is known as multi-class classification.

**Coefficient of determination:** A single number that indicates how well data fits a model. A value of 1 means that the model exactly matches the data; a value of 0 means that the data is random or otherwise cannot be fit to the model. Often referred to as r2, R2, or r-squared.
 
**Feature:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)) 
 
**Feature engineering:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering)
 
**F-score:** A measure that balances precision and recall.
 
**HyperParameter:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter)
 
**Label:**  

**LogLoss:** 

**LogLossReduction:**
 
**Mean absolute error (MAE):** Averages all the model errors, where error is the predicted value distance from the true value.
 
**Model:** 

**N-grams:** A bag of consecutive words sequence counts from a body of text.
 
**Numerical feature vectors:** 
 
**Pipeline:** The connected machine learning workflow; from understanding the problem to acting on the ML output.
 
**Precision:** The proportion of true results to positive results.
 
**Precision and recall metrics:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
 
**Recall:** The fraction of all correct results over all results.
 
**Regression:**: Algorithms that learn to predict the real function value on a data instance. Their input is a labeled examples set. The example is represented by a feature vector, and each label is a real number. A regression algorithm trains a regressor with training examples, which can be used on new unlabeled instances for function value prediction.

**Relative absolute error:** Represents the error as a percentage of the true value.

**Relative squared error:** Normalizes the total squared error by dividing by the predicted values' total squared error.

**Root of mean squared error (RMSE):** Measures the average of the squares of the errors, and then takes the root of that value.
 
**Supervised machine learning:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supervised_learning) 
 
**Training:** 
 
**Transform:** 

**Unsupervised machine learning:** [definition link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)
